HealthApp

HealthApp is a console-based Java application that simulates a personal health management system. The app allows users to manage personal health data and interact with different organs of the human body. It also includes a contact and messaging system, demonstrating practical Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

This project is primarily built to practice Java OOP, improve coding skills, and showcase principles like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and modular design.

Features
Personal Information Management
Store personal details such as name, age, and medical data.
Associate organs (Eyes, Heart, Skin, Stomach) with the person object.
Organ Simulation
Each organ is represented as a class with unique attributes and behaviors.
Users can interact with organs to view details or modify states (e.g., open/close eyes, check heart status).
Contacts & Messaging System
Manage personal contacts with names and phone numbers.
Send and receive messages between contacts.
Search, add, and delete contacts.
User-Friendly Menu
Console-based interactive menu for navigating between organs and messages.
Input validation ensures smooth user experience.
OOP Practices
Uses classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
Demonstrates polymorphism via abstract methods for organs.
Modular design separating UI, models, and utilities.
Technologies Used
Java 17 (or above)
Console-based application
Organized project structure using packages:
Models → Classes for Person and organs
Ui → Menu and interface handling
Utils → Input validation
