HealthApp

HealthApp is a console-based Java application designed to simulate a personal health management system. The application allows users to manage personal health data and simulate interactions with different organs of the human body. It also includes a contact and messaging system to showcase object-oriented programming concepts and practical Java skills.

This project is primarily built to practice Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), improve coding skills, and demonstrate principles like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and modular design.

Features

Personal Information Management

Store personal details such as name, age, and medical data.

Associate organs (Eyes, Heart, Skin, Stomach) with the person object.

Organ Simulation

Each organ is represented as a class with unique attributes and behaviors.

Users can interact with organs to view details or modify states (e.g., open/close eyes, check heart status).

Contacts & Messaging System

Manage personal contacts with names and phone numbers.

Send and receive messages between contacts.

Search, add, and delete contacts.

User-Friendly Menu

Console-based interactive menu for navigating between organs and messages.

Input validation ensures smooth user experience.

OOP Practices

Uses classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

Demonstrates polymorphism via abstract methods for organs.

Modular design separating UI, models, and utilities.

Technologies Used

Java 17 (or above)

Console-based application

Packages for clean project structure:

Models → Classes for Person and organs

Ui → Menu and interface handling

Utils → Input validation
